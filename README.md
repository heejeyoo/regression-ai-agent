# Stock Price Prediction AI Agent with News Sentiment Analysis

## üìà Project Overview

This project is a regression-based AI agent that predicts stock prices by combining traditional financial data with real-time news sentiment analysis. The agent is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to select a stock ticker and receive a price prediction based on a machine learning model.

The core of this project is its unique feature engineering process. It fetches daily stock prices (`Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`) from the **Yahoo Finance API** and simultaneously pulls relevant news headlines from the **NewsAPI**. It then calculates a daily sentiment score and news volume from the headlines, creating a richer feature set for the regression models.

This demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data integration and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Prediction**: Enter any valid stock ticker to get a real-time price prediction.
* **Sentiment-Enhanced Model**: The prediction isn't just based on numbers; it's influenced by the sentiment of recent news, providing a more holistic analysis.
* **Model Insights Dashboard**: Visualize the stock's historical price alongside the calculated daily news sentiment to understand the factors influencing the prediction.
* **Dual Model Comparison**: The backend trains and evaluates both a `Linear Regression` model and a more powerful `XGBoost` model, with the champion model used for final predictions.
* **Professional UI**: A clean, modern interface built with Streamlit, featuring a dark theme suitable for financial applications.
